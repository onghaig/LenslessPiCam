Unreleased
----------

Added
~~~~~

- Option to set image resolution with ``hardware.utils.display`` function.

- Different techniques to use measured background: direct subtraction, learned subtraction, integrated subtraction, concatenated to input.
- Learnable background subtraction for classes that derive from ``lensless.recon.trainable_recon.TrainableReconstructionAlgorithm``.
- Integrated background subtraction object ``lensless.recon.integrated_background.IntegratedBackgroundSub``.
- Option to concatenate background to input to pre-processor.
- Add support for datasets with measured background to ``lensless.utils.dataset.HFDataset``.
