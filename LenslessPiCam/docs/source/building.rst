Building the camera
===================

All the instructions for building a diffuser-based camera with the 
Raspberry Pi HQ Sensor, double-sided tape, and cardboard can be 
found in `this Medium article <https://medium.com/@bezzam/building-a-diffusercam-with-the-raspberry-hq-camera-cardboard-and-tape-896b6020aff6>`__.


For measuring point spread functions (PSFs), you may also need a 
point source generator. In `this article <https://medium.com/@bezzam/measuring-an-optical-psf-with-an-arduino-an-led-and-a-cardboard-box-2f3ddac660c1>`__,
we describe how to make one with an Arduino, a white LED, and a 
cardboard box.
