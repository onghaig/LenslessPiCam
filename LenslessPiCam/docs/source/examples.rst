Examples
========

There are many example scripts on
`GitHub <https://github.com/LCAV/LenslessPiCam/tree/main/scripts>`__,
but they may not be the most intuitive way to get started with the library.
The following notebooks aim to provide a more interactive and intuitive
way to explore different functionalities of the library.

LenslessPiCam General Overview
------------------------------

The notebook below provides a general overview of the library (downloading/using datasets, PSF analysis/design, image recovery):

A local version of the notebook can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/LCAV/LenslessPiCam/blob/main/notebook/lenslesspicam_demo.ipynb>`__.
`Here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PcNhMfjATSwcpbHUMrmc88ciQmheBJ7alz8hel8xnGU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p>`__
are accompanying slides that were given during a PhD course to introduce computational lensless imaging.

System / Hardware
