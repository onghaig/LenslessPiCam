Training and Evaluating Reconstructions
=======================================

`This page <https://github.com/LCAV/LenslessPiCam/blob/main/configs/train#training-physics-informed-reconstruction-models>`__
describes how to launch trainings for learned reconstructions (e.g. unrolled ADMM, trainable inversion, etc).

`This page <https://github.com/LCAV/LenslessPiCam/tree/main/configs/benchmark#benchmark-reconstruction-approaches>`__
describes how to evaluate trained models that are saved on Hugging Face. Traditional methods like ADMM can also be evaluated.
